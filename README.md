# M.sc.-Thesis


Code written for thesis as part of a Master's degree in Computer Science.

Thesis title: Shoulder Surfing Prevention using Deep Neural Networks and Spectral Filtering.

Code written in Python using PyTorch machine learning library.

Three neural networks were trained: 
1. FCN trained on labelled data.
2. Transfer learning approach on previous FCN to extract more information from additional synthetic data.
3. ACGAN for creation of new data following certain criteria.

Perturbation based approach was used to show the existence of human perception principles explicitly learnt by the first neural network.
